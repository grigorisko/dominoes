Name: Vasileios Grigorios Kourakos CS351 Domino Project 

Usage:

Simply run either of the .jar files to play each version of the game 

Game is initialized with 28 dominos as specified in the project pdf.
I believe it should work with more by editing the initialization loops but I have not tested it.

Command line version:

Entry point is the Main class. No command line arguments

Follow the prompts to play the game. When selecting a domino number, the first one is the number 0 and not 1.
Match your domino dots to the left or right side edge dots of the board to play. Draw dominos from the boneyard
until there is an available move. If the boneyard is empty and either of the players have placed their last domino,
or both players have no available moves, the game is over. Player with least remaining dots on dominos wins.

GUI version:

Entry point is the MainGUI class. No command line arguments

Click on your domino to select it. Click the buttons to either rotate, play on the left/right side or
draw a domino from the boneyard if there are no available moves. If the boneyard is empty and either of 
the players have placed their last domino, or both players have no available moves, the game is over. 
Player with least remaining dots on dominos wins.

Bugs: None that I am aware of after testing a bunch.
